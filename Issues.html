<h1>(Possible) Issues</h1>
<ol>
 <li>
  The solution does not incorporate any workaround for artifacts in file due to
 formatting.
 </li>
 <li>
  If the pdf is generated from another file e.g. doc/docx/tex file, there
may be some history from previous version of that stored in the pdf file. The
 solution reads all that data as well in the text. I have not solved removing
  that information.
 </li>
 <li>
  The processing is linear so it may take long time for larger files, the
processing can (and should) be made faster.
 </li>
 <li>
  I tried using lorem_ipsum text for text generation but the "giberish" text
 produced by lorem_ipsum may be detected as some arbitrary language.
 </li>
 <li>
  The method used to check PDF file is too naive, some better method must be
 used if support for only pdf file is required.
 </li>
 <li>
  I have not checked it UTF-8 decoding is enough for decoding
characters following ISO-639-1 standard.
  <ul>
   <li>
    UTF-8 decoding works fine with txt and doc files, but it does not work well
with PDF files, although PDF file specifies that encoding used is UTF-8.
   </li>
   <li>
    May be the bug has to something to do with textract library but I have not
 looked much into that.
   </li>
   <li>
    For textract, it can be solved using tesseract-ocr library with text
 language specified but I am not very convinced by that solution so I did
  not use it here. Another possible approach would be to use method='pdfminer'
    with textract.
   </li>
   <li>
    The program is written for Python3 that is why I have not used
    PDFMiner, as it is supported for Python2.6+
